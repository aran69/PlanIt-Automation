The PlanIT Automation project contains code which combines regression testing, blackbox testing automation via webdrivers,
and hiptest webservice, with potential expansion for Jira compatibility.
The project is explained in greater detail in "PlanIT automation readme.txt", the original documentation I left with the development team.
